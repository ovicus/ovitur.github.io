# Ovitur, Online Booking System
Ovitur is a suite for travel agencies and tour operators that combines inventory management, booking engine, customer relationship management (CRM) and portal content management (CMS) with e-commerce capabilities into one unique Web tool.

## Multicurrency and Multilanguage

Ovitur supports as many currencies as required. The conversion rates are defined in the system itself to be protected against fluctuations. Ovitur has built-in capabilities to handle multiple languages. Translation between languages can be assisted by an automatic translation service.

## Extensible Product Types

Ovitur includes an inventory management tool to handle your products and services (prices, seasons, boards, occupancy), which can be later booked by your customers. At the moment, Ovitur only supports Hotels, but we are working to extend the product types to Flights, Cars, Holidays, Transfers, and any other product types that may be required by our customers.

## Insights with Booking Analysis

One thing that makes Ovitur unique is its capability to provide insights around the booking process. These insights allow your marketing team to better address its marketing campaigns to the right people at the right moment. One image said more than hundred words, and that is why Ovitur includes many predefined charts that may help giving a vision about the entire process, getting the relevant information to you.

## Web 2.0 Booking Portal CMS

Portal provides Web 2.0 capabilities to customers to search, localize and book de desired products and services. The most relevant feature is the capability to find products directly inside a Google Maps, as well as connecting with Twitter and Facebook to increase the customerâ€™s knowledge in marketing campaigns. At the end of the selection process, customers can pay instantly from the portal choosing the appropriate payment method between many, including PayPal.

## Automated Invoices and Vouchers

The booking process includes notifications and vouchers at many states. When a customer sends a quotation for a book, an email is automatically generated and sent to him and to agent to handle the booking. When the customer finally pays, the system generates automatically an invoice and required vouchers and sent to him. The information and appearance of these automated notifications, invoices and vouchers can be modified directly from our management Web tool.

## Connect with External Systems

Nowadays, the Web is an ecosystem where an endless number of applications are connected and interconnected, each one providing to users specifics services, but having a better impact working together. Ovitur can be easily integrated with other systems through its SOAP based Web service interface, a standard protocol to communicate between applications.
